This is my first full-stack project! I built an Amazon clone using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

It includes:
  - A product catalog
  - A cart page
  - Add/Remove from cart
  - Simple design based on Amazon's color and logo

I used this project as a sandbox to learn how to use these technologies together, so there are a few things that might be a bit different:

  - Images are stored in the database as Base64 strings since cloud storage is pricey so the database storage is slightly inefficent.
  - The search bar is just a placeholder and doesnâ€™t work.
